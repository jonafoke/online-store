        <p>
            Two simple words that can change lives. It's short. It's to the point. It's encouraging. It's a kind suggestion that we hope triggers a response in Canadians, 
            making people from all walks of life realize how easy a life-change can be.</p>

        <p>One of the best ways for us to reach out to Canadians is to ensure Canadians can reach out to us.
           The depth and breadth of our product selection is nearly unmatched. Our Online Store enables 
            Canadians in smaller or remote communities to take advantage of our top brand selection 
            and expert service. The strong buying power we've garnered during our legacy in the Canadian 
            sporting goods market means that we are able to bring our customers an enormous selection of 
            some of the best brand names, as well as a number of private label brands unique to our stores.</p>

<p>As the largest national retailer of sporting goods, footwear and apparel in Canada, we've got the tools 
    to get people moving on the path to wellness. Our mission is to inspire every Canadian toward a fit, 
    healthy and active lifestyle. Active Living that a healthy lifestyle can be adopted at any age, 
    any level and within any activity. With this in mind, Active Living has joined forces with a number of 
    organizations geared toward encouraging communities to be active.</p>

<p>Our relationships with many national and regional amateur sports and active lifestyle organizations have 
    helped us reach out to Canadians of all ages, at all levels. From grassroots sporting organizations aimed 
    at getting kids involved in activity at an early age to our ties with national, amateur-level sporting 
    organizations, Active Living is committed helping communities get active.
